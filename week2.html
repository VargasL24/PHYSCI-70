      <p>I started off by doing one of the tutorials posted on the course website. The one that I ended up doing taught me many different things  including how to make a sketch, cut and add parts to a sketch, and how to add parameters to my sketch. It was a fairly quick tutorial however it was very informative. At first I struggled when using fusion 360 because I was lost on if I should make my shape 3D or not. The first time I tried to cut my shape out, it showed all of my lines that I made durring the sketch but not my final product. After I went back and looked at my sketch on fusion 360 I realized that I didnt save my sketch with the final changes that I made after I went back and fixed it I finally had my first successful laser cut.</p>

      <p>I first had to start off by picking my initial shape. I first wanted to make a circle because I would have been able to have a lot more options on where to add my cuts for the press fit. However it was not the most stable fit and because it doesnt have any straight edges it would be a very difficult shape to work with when combining multiple shapes. A triangle Would have been a great shape, due to the fact it is very structurally sound and is one of the coolest shapes in my opinion. I didnt go with that shape because it only had 3 sides, limmiting the different things i could do with it. I finally settled on a hexagon because it has 6 different points for me to connect other hexegons and I thougt it would be an interesting shape to work with.</p>

    <div class="writting">
      <p>The second step was to add the incisions. I first had to add a smaller hexagon marking how deep the incisions would be and then draw a center line for all of the sides that stop at at the smaller hexagon. I offset the line by half of the width of the cardboard I was using and adjsted for .3mm curf. That way when I reflect the line over the center line the final cut would be a perfect fit. I thought that all the lines on the hexagon looked similar to Iron Mans arc reactor.   </p>

      <p> In the end this is what my final product looked in In fusion 360, and after I was finished laser cutting. I first started off with only one because I was still afraid of messing up the laser cutter. Once I successfully made one I started to make more until I finally had enough to make some sort of object. I saw someone else in class make a pyramid in class using triangles, and I was curious to see what it would look like if I connected my hexagons in the same way. I had to force some of the connections together but what I ended up with was a very strong object that I found very visually pleasing. Overall I was extremely happy with my results and I learned a lot about making cuts into shapes using fusion 360. If i could do something different I would have asked for help earlier on In the process. I was lost and wasted a lot of time sitting there instead of looking over the assignment webpage and asking others for help. If i did this earlier I could have saved a lot of time in having to remake shapes and restart my ideas.</p>
