      <p> This weeks assignment was to make something using CNC, as well as to cast and mold an object. I decided that the best aproach was to cast and mold whatever I decided to make using CNC, and this caused some unexpected errors in the process. I started off with the idea of making a kunai. I thought it would be cool to cast it out of metal and keep it around my room as a remider of my time at harvard. I opened fusion 360 and made a simple sketch and set the dimentions to what I assumed would be a good size for a kunai. After this it was time to use the CNC.</p>

      <p> Sadly I forgot to document what the kunai looked like before the casting and molding, however here is what it was like after i reassembled it all. This brings me to the issues I previously mentioned. While the CNC made kunai was in the silicon, it all bonded together extremely well.  The silicon got into all of the crevices of the kunai and when I pulled it appart it split up into multipul peices. Using the CNC was a big challange because it had little simarlarities UI-wise to anyother machines i've used previously. I am still glad with the results and wished that I was able to keep the origional wooden version. While using the CNC to make the kunai one important step was to make sure the mill cut in the inside line of the inner-circle, and on the outside line of the outer edges. One interesting thing I learned was that because you can pick what side of the line you cut on there is no need to adjust for curf. </p>

      <p> The casting and molding was somewhat simple. First I got the two mixtures used to make the casting and added them together with a 1:1 ratio. I struggled finding a container to use to make this casting, and it didn't hit me until later that I could have just made my own container using boxes and hotglue. I was worried about the kunai hitting the botttom of the container so I hotglued a popsicle stick to it at the top to hold it in place. This didnt work that well, and actually made it turn to the corner of the container and touch it in multiple places. This caused Issues when pouring in the metal because it went around the edges of the container and I had to bend it over and over until I was able to take away the big peices of metal you see in the pictures.</p>

      <p> In the end I was happy with the results. I like how you can see the detain of the wood still in the final casting.It was fun taking it back to the dorm and showing it to others, and they all found the process of how it was made to be very interesting. If i were to do this again I would make it slightly bigger so I could hold it properly, as well as make the original CNC version out of wax instead of wood. Another thing that I would have liked to change is the way that I casted it. I found it somewhat wasteful, and I would have liked to use a container that fit the kunai better.</p>
